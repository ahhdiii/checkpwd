# A python command line program used to check the strength of a password

> Uses [getpass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html) library to handle password inputs to securely input the password without being printed on the terminal.

> Prompts the user to re-enter the password to confirm it.

> Checks for atleast one uppercase and lowercase character, special characters and only accepts the password if its length is longer than 8.

> Max attempts limited to 5. For further attempts, restart the program.
